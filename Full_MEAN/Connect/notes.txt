1. use the connect module to create a new web server.
- npm install connect
- will get a connot GET/ response --> there isn't any middleware registered to handle the GET HTTP request.

2. Connect middleware
Connect middleware is just JavaScript function with a unique signature. Each middleware function is de ned with the following three arguments:
• req: This is an object that holds the HTTP request information
• res: This is an object that holds the HTTP response information and allows
you to set the response properties
• next: This is the next middleware function de ned in the ordered set of Connect middleware

First, you added a middleware function named helloWorld(), which has three arguments: req, res, and next. In your middleware, you used the res. setHeader() method to set the response Content-Type header and the res.end() method to set the response text. Finally, you used the app.use() method to register your middleware with the Connect application.

3. Mounting Connect Middleware
Connect middleware supports a feature called mounting, which enables you to determine which request path is required for the middleware function to get executed.
Mounting is done by adding the path argument to the app. use() method.
First, you mounted the helloWorld() middleware to respond only to requests made to the /hello path.
